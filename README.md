📌 AI-Based Recommendation System (Beginner Java Project)

This is a simple recommendation system in Java that suggests products (Books, Movies, Games) based on the user’s favorite category.
The program runs in a loop and continues until the user types END.
Perfect for beginners who want to learn Java basics like:
Using Scanner for user input
if-else conditions
Loops (while)
Writing clean and well-commented code

📖 Supported Categories

📚 Books → Programming and AI-related books
🎬 Movies → Tech-related movies
🎮 Games → Popular strategy and sports games

If the user enters an unsupported category, the program will display:
Sorry! No recommendations available for this category.

🧑‍💻 Code Overview

showRecommendations(String category) → Method to print recommendations based on user choice.
main() → Runs the program, handles user input, and keeps looping until user types END.

✨ Future Improvements

Add more categories (Music, Courses, Gadgets, etc.)
Store recommendations in a file or database instead of hardcoding.
Use AI/ML techniques for smarter recommendations.

Acknowledgements 🙏
